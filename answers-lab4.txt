Part A
Q1
Because the hardware cannot distinguish different errors. Also using this method we can avoid lots of judging and branch switching, so that we can speed up interrupt/exception handling process.

Q2
Because calling "int 14" is violating its DPL limit.

Part B
Q3
Because the IDT entry determined whether user can trigger this interrupt. Setting its DPL to 3 will allow that. Otherwise it will generate a general protection fault due to incorrect DPL.

Q4
Protect the system from buggy and malicious code.
